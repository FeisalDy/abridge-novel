# Condensation Rules

This document defines the editorial rules that govern how novels are condensed in the Abridge project.

These rules exist to ensure that the condensed output is **faithful, objective, readable, and useful** for human decision-making.

The system acts as an editor, not a reviewer.

---

## 1. Purpose of Condensation

Condensation exists to:
- Reduce length while preserving the complete story
- Remove redundancy and padding
- Preserve all plot-relevant information
- Allow a reader to decide whether to read the original novel

Condensation does **not** exist to:
- Judge quality
- Interpret meaning
- Enforce genre expectations
- Replace the original work

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Preserve Facts, Not Interpretation
- Only events, actions, decisions, and outcomes may be included
- No opinions, evaluations, or thematic commentary
- No interpretation of symbolism or author intent

### 2.2 Chronology Must Be Preserved
- Events must appear in the order they occur
- Flashbacks may be included only if they exist in the original text
- Cause must always precede effect

### 2.3 Causality Is Mandatory
- If an event causes future consequences, it must be included
- Decisions and their outcomes must both appear
- No “jumping” over causal links

---

## 3. What Must NEVER Be Removed

The following elements must always be preserved in some form:

- Deaths and resurrections
- Reincarnation or identity transfer
- Major injuries or permanent changes
- Character introductions
- Relationship changes (alliances, betrayals, romance, enmity)
- Changes in power, status, rank, or ability
- Major decisions and turning points
- Information that affects future plot events
- Endings of arcs and resolutions of conflicts

If removing an element would make later events unclear, it must stay.

---

## 4. What MAY Be Reduced or Removed

The following may be shortened or removed **only if they do not affect outcomes**:

- Repetitive internal monologue leading to the same decision
- Repeated training or routine scenes with no new result
- Extended scenery or environmental description
- Slice-of-life interactions with no future relevance
- Repetitive exposition already established earlier

Removal must never break continuity or understanding.

---

## 5. Character Handling Rules

- Character names must be preserved
- Identity changes must be explicitly stated
- If multiple names or titles exist, the primary identity must remain clear
- Vague references should be clarified if ambiguity would confuse the reader

Characters should remain consistent and recognizable throughout the condensed text.

---

## 6. Style and Tone Rules

The condensed output must follow these style constraints:

- Neutral tone
- Third-person perspective
- Past tense
- No meta commentary
- No references to “the reader” or “the author”
- No genre labels or trope names
- No opinions (positive or negative)

The output should read like an abridged novel, not an analysis.

---

## 7. Structural Rules

- The condensed text should be readable as a standalone narrative
- Transitions between events must be clear
- Scene or chapter boundaries may be preserved if helpful
- Length reduction should be gradual and proportional, not abrupt

---

## 8. Genre and Metadata Separation

- Genre detection must not influence condensation
- Genre labels, if present, must appear only as separate metadata
- The condensed narrative itself must remain genre-neutral

---

## 9. Success Criteria

Condensation is considered successful if:

- The full plot can be understood without the original novel
- All major events and consequences are present
- The narrative flows logically
- The reader can independently decide whether to read the original work

---

## 10. Editorial Identity

Abridge behaves like a disciplined editor.

It cuts excess.
It preserves meaning.
It does not judge.
