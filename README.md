# Abridge

Abridge started from a very simple frustration.

I enjoy long novels, especially web novels and serialized fiction, but many of them are *huge*. Millions of words. Hundreds or thousands of chapters. Deciding whether a story is worth committing that amount of time often requires reading far more than I want to upfront.

I didn’t want reviews.
I didn’t want ratings.
I didn’t want someone else’s opinion telling me whether a novel was “good”.

I just wanted a **shorter version of the story itself** — faithful, complete, and neutral — so *I* could decide.

That idea became Abridge.

## The Original Focus: Condensation Only

At the beginning, Abridge had exactly one goal:

> Take a full novel and condense it without changing the story.

Not summarize.
Not analyze.
Not interpret.

Just remove repetition, padding, and filler while preserving:

* All plot events
* Chronology
* Cause and effect
* Character actions and consequences

The condensed result should read like an abridged edition of the novel — shorter, faster to read, but still the same story.

If the original novel takes weeks to read, the condensed version should take hours — and still let the reader understand everything that happened.

## A Strict Rule: No Judgment

Very early on, I realized something important:

The moment the system starts judging, it stops being useful.

So Abridge follows a strict rule:

* No opinions
* No quality judgments
* No “important vs unimportant” decisions based on taste
* No literary criticism

Abridge does not decide whether a novel is good.
It only makes the novel **smaller and clearer**.

The final judgment is always made by the reader.

## An Unexpected Discovery: Side Features Emerged

While building the condensation pipeline, something interesting happened.

To condense faithfully, the system had to *understand structure*:

* Who appears often
* Who interacts with whom
* Which events trigger other events
* How arcs are connected

Out of that necessity, side features started to naturally emerge:

* Character lists
* Relationship matrices
* Event keyword maps
* Genre and tag signals derived from plot facts

These were never the main goal.
They appeared as **byproducts of structural analysis**, not as interpretations.

At that point, Abridge stopped being “just a condenser” and became something slightly broader:
a tool that can expose a novel’s structure **without judging it**.

---

## Keeping the Boundary Clear

Even as these features grew, one boundary remained non-negotiable:

> Condensation must never be influenced by analysis.

Genre detection, character salience, and tags are always:

* Optional
* Separate from the condensed narrative
* Derived *after* condensation, not during

The condensed text stays clean, neutral, and story-only.

Metadata stays metadata.

## What Abridge Is (and Is Not)

Abridge is:

* A tool for faithful long-form condensation
* A way to explore very large novels efficiently
* A support system for human decision-making

Abridge is not:

* A review engine
* A recommendation system
* A literary critic
* A replacement for reading the original novel

If anything, its purpose is the opposite:
to help readers decide *whether* they want to read more.

## Where the Project Stands Now

What began as a single-purpose idea evolved into a layered system:

* Condense first
* Understand structure second
* Expose information without interpretation

The core motivation hasn’t changed.

Abridge exists because sometimes, the hardest part of reading a long novel
is deciding whether to begin at all.

This project is my attempt to make that decision easier —
without taking it away from the reader.
