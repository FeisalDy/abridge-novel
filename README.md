# Abridge

Abridge is a project focused on **faithful, objective condensation of full-length novels**.

The goal is to take very long novels (including million-word works) and produce a **long-form condensed version** that preserves the entire plot, chronology, and causality, allowing a reader to decide whether the original novel is worth reading.

This project does **not** judge, rate, or review novels.
It does **not** attempt literary criticism or subjective evaluation.

The condensed output is intended to function like an abridged edition:
shorter, faster to read, but faithful to the original story.
