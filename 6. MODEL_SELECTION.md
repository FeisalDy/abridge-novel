# Model Selection Guide for Abridge

This document explains **how to choose an LLM model** for use with Abridge.

Abridge is an **editorial condensation engine**, not a creative writing system.
Model choice directly affects narrative fidelity, determinism, and trustworthiness.

This guide defines:
- What the model is required to do
- What characteristics matter most
- How to evaluate candidate models
- Common failure modes to avoid

---

## 1. What Abridge Requires From a Model

Abridge tasks the model with acting as:

> **A disciplined literary editor performing loss-averse condensation over long narrative text**

This is fundamentally different from:
- generic summarization
- creative rewriting
- opinionated analysis

The model must preserve story mechanics, not reinterpret them.

---

## 2. Core Model Requirements (In Priority Order)

When selecting a model, prioritize the following attributes **in this order**:

### 2.1 Narrative Fidelity (Critical)

The model must:
- Preserve all events, actions, decisions, and outcomes
- Preserve chronology and causal relationships
- Avoid merging or abstracting distinct events

If fidelity fails, the output is unusable.

---

### 2.2 Instruction Obedience

Abridge relies on **negative constraints**, such as:
- “Do not add opinions”
- “Do not omit events that influence future developments”
- “Do not rewrite into an abstract summary”

Many models violate these implicitly.

A suitable model must reliably obey:
- prohibition rules
- stylistic constraints
- neutrality requirements

---

### 2.3 Compression Stability

The model should produce:
- consistent compression ratios
- low variance across chapters
- predictable behavior across stages (chapter → arc → novel)

Large swings in compression are dangerous and usually indicate silent narrative loss.

---

### 2.4 Low Hallucination Pressure

For Abridge, hallucination includes:
- invented motivations
- implied causality not present in the text
- explanatory transitions added for “smoothness”

The model must remain literal and conservative.

---

### 2.5 Long-Context Degradation Behavior

The model must:
- behave consistently near context limits
- avoid quietly dropping minor events at large input sizes

Graceful degradation or explicit failure is preferred over silent loss.

---

### 2.6 Determinism & Reproducibility

Abridge favors models that:
- behave consistently at low temperature
- produce similar outputs across repeated runs
- do not “creatively diverge” under identical inputs

Determinism improves debuggability and trust.

---

### 2.7 Cost Predictability

Cost matters, but **cost per trusted run** matters more than cost per token.

Models that cause:
- reruns
- guardrail violations
- manual inspection overhead

are effectively more expensive.

---

## 3. What Abridge Does *Not* Need From a Model

Do not optimize for:

- Creativity
- Stylistic flair
- Emotional intelligence
- Literary interpretation
- Genre awareness

These traits actively increase risk.

---

## 4. Model Archetypes and Suitability

### 🟢 Disciplined Editors (Preferred)

Traits:
- Literal
- Conservative
- Instruction-obedient
- Low embellishment

Examples:
- Qwen-3-32B
- Large instruction-tuned models with conservative defaults

These models are ideal for Abridge.

---

### 🟡 Creative Summarizers (Risky)

Traits:
- Over-abstract
- Merge events
- Add connective interpretation

Use only with strong guardrails and validation.

---

### 🔴 Chatty or Opinionated Models (Unsuitable)

Traits:
- Add evaluations
- Explain motivations
- “Improve” prose

These violate Abridge’s editorial neutrality and should be avoided.

---

## 5. Model Size Considerations

Bigger is not always better.

For Abridge:
- A disciplined 32B model is often safer than a creative 70B model
- Larger models may “help” in ways that break neutrality

Constraint obedience matters more than raw capability.

---

## 6. How to Evaluate a Candidate Model

Use **real pipeline data**, not synthetic benchmarks.

Recommended tests:
1. Condense a repetitive chapter
2. Condense a morally charged scene
3. Condense a dense plot chapter
4. Compare compression ratios across stages
5. Inspect guardrail violations
6. Compare cost per successful run

Use Abridge’s:
- guardrails
- cost tracking
- unified run report

to make decisions empirically.

---

## 7. Current Recommendation

As of now:

- **Qwen-3-32B** is a strong default choice
- It balances instruction obedience, stability, and cost
- It aligns well with Abridge’s editorial identity

Model choice should remain configurable and periodically re-evaluated.

---

## 8. Future Considerations

In later versions:
- Different models may be used for metadata extraction
- Condensation should remain model-conservative
- Reader-facing intelligence should be isolated

Do not mix creative and editorial models in the same stage.

---

## 9. Guiding Principle

> **Abridge rewards boring, obedient models.**

If a model feels “smart”, it is probably wrong for this task.

Preserve the story.
Do not reinterpret it.
