# Abridge – Feature Expansion Roadmap

This document lists **optional features** that can be added to Abridge *after v1*.
The core pipeline (chapter → arc → novel condensation) is considered **complete and stable**.

All features below are **additive** and must not compromise:
- Faithful narrative preservation
- Editorial neutrality
- Deterministic pipeline behavior

---

## v1 Status (Completed)

The following capabilities are fully implemented:

- Chapter-level condensation
- Arc-level condensation
- Full novel condensation
- Model-agnostic LLM abstraction
- API or local LLM support
- Million-word novel scalability
- Objective, non-evaluative abridgement output

---

## Tier 1 — Operational & Quality Improvements (Recommended)

These features improve usability, safety, and cost control without adding narrative intelligence.

### 1. Resume / Skip Flags
Allow skipping completed pipeline stages.

Examples:
- `--skip-chapters`
- `--skip-arcs`
- Auto-detect existing outputs

Purpose:
- Save time and cost
- Enable crash recovery
- Support iterative experimentation

---

### 2. Progress Logging
Provide visibility during long-running jobs.

Examples:
- Current chapter / arc index
- Percentage complete
- Estimated remaining time

Scope:
- Console output
- Optional log file

---

### 3. Cost & Token Tracking
Track LLM usage per stage.

Metrics:
- Tokens per stage
- Cost per stage
- Total cost per novel

Purpose:
- Budget awareness
- Model comparison
- Cost optimization

---

### 4. Length Ratio Guardrails
Detect over-condensation early.

Examples:
- Chapter condensed length ≥ X% of original
- Arc condensed length ≥ Y% of merged chapters

Purpose:
- Prevent silent narrative loss
- Catch prompt or model regressions

---

## Tier 2 — Structural Enhancements (Low Risk Intelligence)

These features extract structure without interpretation or judgment.

### 5. Scene Detection (Optional)
Detect scene boundaries within chapters.

Possible signals:
- POV shifts
- Time jumps
- Location changes

Use case:
- Finer-grained condensation
- Improved narrative flow

---

### 6. Character Name Index
Extract and index character names.

Output:
- Name list
- First appearance
- Frequency counts

Important:
- No relationship inference
- No role classification

---

### 7. Chapter Metadata Extraction
Extract neutral metadata such as:
- Time progression
- Location changes
- POV changes

Purpose:
- Reader navigation
- Structural clarity

---

## Tier 3 — Reader-Facing Intelligence (Optional)

These features help readers decide whether a novel matches their preferences.

### 8. Genre Detection
Detect likely genres based on condensed content.

Characteristics:
- Multi-label
- Confidence scores
- Optional feature

Important:
- Genre ≠ quality
- No evaluative language

---

### 9. Trope / Tag Detection
Detect common narrative tropes.

Examples:
- Reincarnation
- Gender-bender
- Time loop
- Political intrigue

Approach:
- Declarative detection only
- No sentiment or judgment

---

### 10. Protagonist Profile
Extract protagonist-related information.

Examples:
- Main character name(s)
- POV dominance
- Life state changes (e.g., reincarnation, gender change)

Purpose:
- Reader orientation
- Preference filtering

---

## Tier 4 — Advanced & High-Risk Features (Optional, Future)

These features are complex and error-prone and should only be attempted after extensive validation.

### 11. Character Relationship Graph
Infer relationships between characters.

Requirements:
- Coreference resolution
- Event linking
- High-quality entity recognition

Risk:
- Hallucination
- Misinterpretation

---

### 12. Multi-Version Condensation
Generate multiple condensed outputs.

Examples:
- 10k-word version
- 25k-word version
- 50k-word version

Use case:
- Reader choice
- Different reading depths

---

### 13. Comparative Condensation (Series Support)
Compare multiple books.

Examples:
- Differences between volumes
- “What changed since last book?”

Use case:
- Long series readers

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

The following features are intentionally excluded:

- Quality scoring
- Recommendation ranking
- Sentiment analysis
- Moral judgment
- Author intent inference

Abridge exists to **inform readers**, not to judge literature.

---

## Recommended Development Order

**Phase 1**
1. Resume / skip flags
2. Progress logging
3. Cost tracking
4. Length guardrails

**Phase 2**
5. Genre detection
6. Protagonist profile
7. Trope tagging

**Phase 3**
8. Relationship graph (only if strongly needed)

---

## Design Principle Reminder

Abridge is an **editorial condensation engine**, not a review system.

All future features must preserve:
- Narrative fidelity
- Neutral tone
- Reader autonomy
